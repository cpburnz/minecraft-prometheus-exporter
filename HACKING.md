These instructions are written with Linux in mind because that is my development environment.


Java Environment
----------------

Create a ".env" file, and assign the `JAVA_HOME` variable to the path of the
Java 8 JDK. E.g.,

```shell
# Define the version of Java to use with Gradle (i.e., "./gradlew").
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk
```

The "env-gradlew" script is a wrapper around "gradlew", and loads the ".env" file to ensure Gradle is run with the proper version of Java.


IDE Projects
------------

Project files for IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse can be generated by running the "idea" and "eclipse" tasks, respectively:

```shell
./env-gradlew idea
# OR
./env-gradlew eclipse
```


Playtesting
-----------

The Minecraft client can be run directly with the mod by running the "runClient" task:

```shell
./env-gradlew runClient
```

Once a world has been launched within Minecraft, the metrics can be inspected by running:

```shell
curl -Ss 'http://localhost:19565/metrics'
```


Compiling
---------

The release JAR can be compiled by running the "assemble" task:

```shell
./env-gradlew assemble
```

The release JAR will be located at "build/libs/Prometheus-Exporter-{MC Version}-forge-{Mod Version}.jar".
