# This is an example configuration. The mod configuration is located at

[collector]
	#Enable collecting metrics about the JVM process.
	jvm = true
	#Enable collecting metrics about the Minecraft server.

	#Configure how to handle dimension (world) tick errors. Some mods handle the tick events for their custom dimensions, and may not reliably start and stop ticks as expected.
	#  IGNORE: Ignore tick errors. If a mod really botches tick events, it could emit up to 20 log statements per second for each dimension. This would cause large ballooning of the "logs/debug.txt" file. Use this setting, or figure out how to filter out DEBUG messages for "com.github.cpburnz.minecraft_prometheus_exporter.MinecraftCollector/" in "log4j2.xml".
	#  LOG: Log tick errors. This is the new default.
	#  STRICT: Raise an exception on tick error. This will crash the server if an error occurs.
	#Allowed Values: IGNORE, LOG, STRICT
	mc_dimension_tick_errors = "LOG"
	#Enable collecting metrics about the entities in each dimension (world).
